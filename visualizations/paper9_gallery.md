**The Multilayer Parasite: Corruption Evolution Visualizations**

This gallery showcases the key visualizations generated by the computational analysis of corruption evolution in Argentina (1880-2025).

## Figure 1: Corruption Layer Evolution Timeline (1880-2025)

**File:** `layer_evolution_timeline.png`  
**Type:** Stacked area chart  
**Key Insight:** Shows the accumulation pattern of corruption layers over 145 years

### What it shows:
- **Temporal emergence** of each corruption layer
- **Persistence patterns** - no layer ever goes extinct  
- **Accumulation behavior** - new layers supplement rather than replace old ones
- **Maximum diversification** achieved by 2025 with all 4 layers simultaneously active

### Key observations:
- Electoral corruption (blue) dominates 1880-1920, then stabilizes at ~33% by 2025
- Administrative corruption (orange) emerges 1912, peaks mid-century, remains at 65% in 2025
- Entrepreneurial corruption (green) explodes after 1990 privatizations, maintains 62% in 2025
- Compliance capture (red) appears 2017, immediately reaches 100% activity by 2025

## Figure 2: Layer Persistence Heatmap

**File:** `layer_persistence_heatmap.png`  
**Type:** Temporal heatmap with persistence scores  
**Key Insight:** Reveals the biofilm's resistance to extinction across time periods

### What it shows:
- **Persistence intensity** for each layer across decades
- **Environmental resistance** - layers survive political changes, economic crises, reform attempts
- **Mutual protection effects** - when one layer weakens, others strengthen
- **No extinction events** - darkest periods never reach zero

### Critical finding:
Even during peak anti-corruption periods (1912 Sáenz Peña reforms, 1983 democratic transition, 2015-2019 Macri administration), no layer completely disappears.

## Figure 3: Compliance Battlefield Distribution

**File:** `compliance_battlefield.png`  
**Type:** Pie chart with categorical breakdown  
**Key Insight:** Reveals the capture of anti-corruption systems themselves

### Distribution breakdown:
- **Genuine (13.3%)** - Green slice: Actually fighting corruption but struggling
- **Cosmetic (33.3%)** - Yellow slice: Performance theater without substance  
- **Captured (10.0%)** - Red slice: Weaponized for competitive advantage
- **Transitional (36.7%)** - Orange slice: Evolving toward effectiveness or capture
- **Other (6.7%)** - Gray slice: Unclear classification

### Critical implications:
- Only 1 in 8 compliance programs genuinely combat corruption
- 1 in 3 serve as mere cosmetic theater
- Over 1 in 3 remain in vulnerable transitional states
- **Compliance itself has become a corruption vector**

## Figure 4: Fitness Paradox - Citations vs Impact

**File:** `fitness_paradox.png`  
**Type:** Dual bar chart comparing formal recognition vs real-world effectiveness  
**Key Insight:** Exposes the inversion between legal discourse and practical outcomes

### The paradox revealed:
- **Anti-corruption Citation Fitness**: 0.013 (higher formal legal recognition)
- **Pro-corruption Citation Fitness**: 0.011 (lower formal legal recognition)
- **BUT...**
- **Anti-corruption Real Impact**: 0.348 (lower practical success)
- **Pro-corruption Real Impact**: 0.801 (higher practical success)

### Interpretation:
Anti-corruption measures receive more citations and formal legal recognition but achieve significantly less real-world impact. This suggests **sophisticated capture of legal discourse** - corruption allows anti-corruption to dominate the formal conversation while maintaining practical control.

## Figure 5: Biofilm Protection Network

**File:** `biofilm_protection_network.png`  
**Type:** Network diagram with protection coefficients  
**Key Insight:** Maps the mutual protection relationships between corruption layers

### Network structure:
- **Nodes**: Four corruption layers sized by current persistence
- **Edges**: Protection coefficients showing mutual defense strength
- **Colors**: Protection intensity (red = strong, yellow = moderate, green = weak)

### Key protection relationships:
- **Entrepreneurial ↔ Administrative**: Strongest mutual protection (0.33)
- **Administrative ↔ Electoral**: Moderate protection (0.23) 
- **Electoral ↔ Compliance**: Emerging protection (0.20)
- **Compliance ↔ Entrepreneurial**: New alliance (0.11)

### System properties:
- **High connectivity**: All layers protect all others
- **Redundant pathways**: Multiple protection routes prevent single-point failures
- **Circular protection**: Each layer benefits from and contributes to system resilience

## Figure 6: Mutation Prediction Radar

**File:** `mutation_prediction_radar.png`  
**Type:** Radar chart with probability and timeline axes  
**Key Insight:** Forecasts corruption evolution under current enforcement pressures

### Predicted mutations (next 5 years):

1. **Regulatory Arbitrage** (Northeast quadrant)
   - **Probability**: 62% (high risk)
   - **Timeline**: 6-18 months (immediate threat)
   - **Description**: Forum shopping between jurisdictions and regulatory frameworks

2. **ESG Compliance Capture** (Southeast quadrant)  
   - **Probability**: 58% (high risk)
   - **Timeline**: 12-24 months (medium-term threat)
   - **Description**: Weaponizing sustainability frameworks for competitive advantage

3. **Digital Governance Capture** (Southwest quadrant)
   - **Probability**: 45% (moderate risk)
   - **Timeline**: 24-36 months (long-term threat)
   - **Description**: Capturing AI and digital governance systems from inception

4. **Compliance Professional Capture** (Northwest quadrant)
   - **Probability**: 40% (moderate risk)  
   - **Timeline**: 18-30 months (medium-term threat)
   - **Description**: Systematic recruitment and conversion of compliance professionals

### Countermeasure urgency:
- **Immediate attention needed**: Regulatory arbitrage (6-18 months)
- **Strategic preparation required**: ESG capture (12-24 months)
- **Long-term monitoring**: Digital and professional capture (18+ months)

## Figure 7: Comprehensive Research Dashboard

**File:** `comprehensive_dashboard.png`  
**Type:** Multi-panel dashboard integrating all key metrics

2. **Top Right**: Biofilm Score gauge (0.611)  
3. **Middle Left**: Layer persistence bars (current status)
4. **Middle Right**: Compliance battlefield pie chart
5. **Bottom**: Historical timeline with key events and interventions

### At-a-glance insights:
- **System Status**: High protection, moderate accumulation
- **Current Threat**: Compliance capture at 100% activity
- **Historical Pattern**: Consistent evolution despite reform attempts
- **Future Risk**: Multiple high-probability mutations predicted
