# 🧬 Dawkins 2024 Extended Phenotype Legal Theory Framework

## 📋 Executive Summary

This repository contains the **first computational implementation** of Richard Dawkins' 2024 Extended Phenotype Theory applied to legal systems, developed by **Ignacio Adrián Lerer**. The framework revolutionizes legal analysis by treating law not as naturally evolved systems, but as **CONSTRUCTED phenotypes** that extend the power of constructors (states, corporations, institutions) into the legal environment.

## 🎯 Core Theoretical Innovation

### Traditional Legal Theory vs Extended Phenotype Theory

| Traditional View | Extended Phenotype View |
|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Law evolves naturally | Law is **actively constructed** |
| Legal systems adapt organically | Legal systems are **designed artifacts** |
| Institutional evolution | **Constructor power extension** |
| Natural selection of norms | **Strategic phenotype construction** |

### Key Conceptual Breakthroughs

1. **Legal Constructors**: Entities (states, corporations, international organizations) that actively build legal structures as extensions of their interests
2. **Legal Phenotypes**: Laws, institutions, and procedures as constructed artifacts extending constructor power
3. **Palimpsest Constraints**: Historical layers that constrain new legal construction (cannot "start from scratch")
4. **Legal Viruses**: Norms classified as verticoviruses (intergenerational) vs horizontoviruses (immediate benefit)
5. **Constructor Gene Conflicts**: Internal conflicts within constructors resolved through "parliamentary" processes
