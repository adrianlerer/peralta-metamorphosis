Constructor classes - Entities that actively construct legal phenotypes

Constructors are the active agents in legal system evolution:
- Corporate constructors (companies, multinational corporations)
- State constructors (national, provincial, municipal governments)
- Technology constructors (tech platforms, AI systems)
- International constructors (EU, UN, World Bank, etc.)
- Civil society constructors (NGOs, advocacy groups)

These entities CONSTRUCT legal structures as extensions of their "genes" (interests/memes)
rather than being passive subjects of legal evolution.
