Legal Phenotype classes - Extended phenotypes constructed by legal constructors

Legal phenotypes are the extended phenotypes in Dawkins' theory as applied to law:
- Regulatory phenotypes (regulations, rules, standards)
- Institutional phenotypes (courts, agencies, procedures)
- Doctrinal phenotypes (legal doctrines, precedents)
- Legislative phenotypes (laws, statutes, constitutional provisions)

These are the "extended bodies" that constructors build to influence
their environment and serve their interests.
