## ABSTRACT

This study traces the genealogical transmission of the Roman legal principle *bona fides* from its pre-classical origins through contemporary digital applications, using systematic methodology to identify persistence mechanisms, adaptation patterns, and evolutionary pressures. Through analysis of primary sources, medieval transmission networks, modern codification processes, and contemporary legal databases, we document a 2,000-year evolutionary trajectory characterized by semantic stability, functional adaptability, and cross-system convergence. 🟡 **DOCUMENTED**

**Key Findings**: 
- 🟢 **VERIFIED**: Textual continuity from Roman praetorial formulae to modern civil codes
- 🟡 **DOCUMENTED**: Medieval preservation via canonical law and university transmission 
- 🟡 **DOCUMENTED**: Modern codification in major legal systems (Code Civil 1804, BGB 1896)
- 🟠 **ANALYTICAL**: Contemporary digital integration in smart contracts and international commerce

### 3.2 Justinian Codification (527-534 CE)

🟢 **VERIFIED - CORPUS JURIS CIVILIS**:

**Digest References**:
- **Title 19.1 - De actionibus empti et venditi**: Systematic treatment of good faith in sales contracts
- **Title 16.3 - De verborum obligationibus**: Distinction between *stricti iuris* and *bonae fidei* obligations
