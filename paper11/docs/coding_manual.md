# Paper 11: Political Actor Coding Manual

## Overview

This manual provides comprehensive guidelines for coding political actors across the four-dimensional framework used in Paper 11. Each dimension is measured on a 1-10 scale with detailed criteria for consistent, reliable coding.

## Coding Principles

### General Guidelines
1. **Consistency**: Apply the same standards across all actors
2. **Evidence-Based**: Base ratings on documented positions and actions
3. **Temporal Context**: Consider the historical period of each actor
4. **Multiple Sources**: Use triangulation from various reliable sources
5. **Objectivity**: Minimize personal political bias in assessments

### Scale Interpretation
- **1-2**: Strong opposition/minimal presence
- **3-4**: Moderate opposition/weak presence  
- **5-6**: Neutral/mixed positions
- **7-8**: Moderate support/presence
- **9-10**: Strong support/maximum presence

## Coding Procedure

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Actor Research Phase
- Collect primary sources (speeches, manifestos, policy positions)
- Review secondary sources (academic analyses, biographical works)
- Identify key policy positions and statements
- Note temporal context and evolution of positions

#### 2. Initial Coding Phase
- Rate each dimension based on collected evidence
- Document specific evidence for each rating
- Note any ambiguities or conflicting information
- Flag areas requiring additional research

#### 3. Validation Phase
- Cross-check ratings against multiple sources
- Verify consistency across related dimensions
- Compare with expert assessments where available
- Adjust ratings based on additional evidence

#### 4. Quality Control Phase
- Independent second coder review
- Resolve discrepancies through discussion
- Final consensus rating determination
- Documentation of final rationale

### Documentation Requirements

For each actor, maintain:
- **Source list**: All materials consulted
- **Evidence log**: Specific quotes and positions supporting each rating
- **Rationale**: Explanation for each dimensional score
- **Confidence level**: Assessment of coding certainty (1-10 scale)
- **Notes**: Any special considerations or contextual factors

### Common Coding Challenges

#### Temporal Consistency
- **Problem**: Actor positions evolve over time
- **Solution**: Focus on predominant positions during peak influence period
- **Alternative**: Create temporal profiles for significant position changes

#### Cultural Context
- **Problem**: Different cultural contexts for similar positions
- **Solution**: Adjust for local political spectrum while maintaining comparative validity
- **Approach**: Use relative positioning within national context

#### Limited Information
- **Problem**: Insufficient documentation for reliable coding
- **Solution**: Use available evidence with confidence rating adjustment
- **Alternative**: Exclude actor if information insufficient for valid coding

#### Contradictory Evidence
- **Problem**: Conflicting statements or positions
- **Solution**: Weight evidence by source quality and temporal proximity
- **Approach**: Document contradictions and explain final decision rationale

## Quality Assurance

### Inter-Coder Reliability

**Target Standards**:
- Cohen's κ ≥ 0.80 for acceptable reliability
- Intraclass correlation ≥ 0.90 for excellent reliability
- Maximum 1-point difference on 10-point scales

**Reliability Testing Procedure**:
1. Initial independent coding of 10 actors by multiple coders
2. Calculate inter-rater reliability statistics
3. Identify and resolve systematic disagreements
4. Retrain coders if reliability below standards
5. Proceed with remaining actors using refined procedures

### Validation Checks

#### Internal Consistency
- Check for logical relationships between dimensions
- Flag unusual combinations for review
- Verify against theoretical expectations

#### External Validation
- Compare subset of ratings with expert assessments
- Cross-reference with established political science measures
- Validate against objective policy indicators where available

#### Temporal Validation
- Test coding stability across time periods
- Assess consistency of evolutionary patterns
- Validate major position changes with historical evidence
